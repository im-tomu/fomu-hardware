= Tomu FPGA - **Production** Version

https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-hardware/tree/master/archive/pvt/releases/pvt1[Current EVT version is `pvt1`]

This directory contains the **production** version of the Tomu FPGA. The
production version is designed for mass production. It uses advanced PCB
technologies which are harder for the average maker and hobbyist to access.

These features are:

* Laser drilled and blind vias -- this allows industry standard footprints for
  the WCSP parts, increasing long term reliability of the solder joints.

* Hard gold plating of USB pads and touch pads. This is designed to increase
  reliability and the number of insertions and removals before failure.

* TVS protection on all inputs. This means Tomu FPGA should be able to withstand
  more handling without getting destroyed.

You get a production version if you order from https://xobs.io/[Sean 'xobs' Cross] https://j.mp/fomu-cs[through or after the Crowd Supply campaign].

== Programming Jig

image:images/fomu_pvt_jig.jpg[Pogo-pin programming jig]

3D printable programming jig, freecad link:./fomu-pvt-jig.FCStd[design file].

Used with the following (but surely variations would work as well):

* print 3 layers
** two to align the pins and one to hold the fomu
* spring probe pogo pins
** 0.48mm diameter point
** 0.68mm diameter shaft
** 16.55mm thimble length
* mini grabber test hooks

The pogo pin holes are quite tight and required a bit of clearing with a sewing
pin. When using the mini grabbers, so as to not require soldering, the pins
require a bit of a bend to make space.
