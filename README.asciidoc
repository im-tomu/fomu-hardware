link:https://tomu.im[I'm Tomu] FPGA (Fomu for short!) a tiny FPGA board that fits in
your USB port. People sometimes call me "Fomu" for short!

I have four buttons and an RGB LED.

== Telling Tomu and Tomu FPGA apart!

Professionally produced Tomu boards have the following color scheme;

 * https://j.mp/tomu-fs[Tomu **FPGA** boards are **blue**].
 * https://j.mp/tomu-cs[**Original** Tomu boards are **green**].

However, as people are encouraged to produce their own Tomu boards, please look
at the device **careful** to check what type you have. See the following table
for what to look for;

[cols="3",]
|================================================================
|             | **Original** Tomu                 | Tomu **FPGA**
| Board Color | Green                             | Blue
| LEDs        | One Green + One Red               | One Red Green Blue LED
| Components
| A single **large** black IC taking up most of the board.
| Multiple little black ICs covering the board.

| Test point pattern
| **FIXME**

|================================================================

The original Tomu has one large black IC on the board.

== Board Variants

There are several variants of Fomu hardware

=== link:./hacker[Hacker version]

* The hacker version is designed for people who are up to the challenge of building their own board.
* It has a simpler PCB which makes it cheaper to produce in a small quantities.
* *However*, it uses a non-standard footprint for the FPGA WSCP which reduces yield and long term reliability making it unsuitable for mass production.
* It's also missing some decoupling capacitors and power filters, which may impact stability
* Only two SPI wires are connected, meaning it cannot handle quad SPI

=== link:./archive/evt[Production version EVT]

* This is a prototype board designed to fit on top of a Raspberry Pi
* It does not fit on a USB port
* The large size makes it easier to debug
* The schematic serves as the basis for future production boards
* It uses 6/6 design rules, making it very easy to produce

=== link:./archive/dvt[Production version DVT]

* The first test run using advanced PCB technologies like laser drilled and blind vias
* If there are no changes, this will be mass produced

=== link:./archive/pvt[Production version PVT]

* You get a production version if you order from https://xobs.io/[Sean 'xobs' Cross] https://j.mp/fomu-cs[through or after the Crowd Supply campaign].

== FPGA Specifications


There are currently *two* versions of Tomu FPGA. Both boards and based
around mostly the same schematic and should be mostly compatible and
based around the Lattice iCE40UP5K FPGA and have the same set of
features listed below;

* http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40UltraPlus[Lattice iCE40 UltraPlus 5K]
  - 5K 4 input LUTs + DSP tiles
  - 128 kilo**bytes** internal SRAM
  - 1024 kilo**bytes** (or more) flash (XIP possible)
* 1 x RGB LED
* 2 x touch buttons

== Development Firmware

The Lattice iCE40UP5K has a fully open source
https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog[Verilog] â†’ https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream[Bitstream] toolchain.

Supported by the https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv/wiki[LiteX BuildEnv].
The LiteX BuildEnv supports your
https://github.com/timvideos/litex-buildenv/wiki/SoftCPU[choice of CPU architecture];
